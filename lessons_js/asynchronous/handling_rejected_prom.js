/*
 *In a promise chain like the one in this code, if an error occurs in the middle of the chain, the code after the error will not be executed. The promise chain will be broken, and the control will be passed to the nearest catch() method.

* When an error occurs, the code jumps directly to the nearest catch() method,or(if you have a then method in which the second callback is defined, it goes there, because it is also meant for promise rejection, but in this case the chain wont break) and skips all the subsequent then() methods. Any code in those then() methods will not be executed. 
* but the finally is still executed.
 */

//* it is also worth noting that , if you getCountryAndNeighbourWithErrorHandling("random_country"), it is worth noting that the promise is still fulfilled but with a  http response of 404, but "catch" wont be able to catch it because it is not promise rejection!!!!!!!!!!, which is logically wrong.
